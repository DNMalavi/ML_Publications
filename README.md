**1**. **Detection of Saffron Adulteration with Crocus Sativus Style Using NIR-Hyperspectral Imaging and Chemometrics**


<div style="text-align: justify;">
Saffron is a valuable spice that is often adulterated. This study proposes using near-infrared hyperspectral imaging (NIR-HSI) and chemometrics as a fast and cost-effective method for detecting and quantifying adulteration in saffron stigmas. Adulterated saffron samples were prepared by adding Crocus sativus style to pure saffron stigmas in varying concentrations (20–90%). Spectral data preprocessing used standard normal variate (SNV) and multiplicative scatter correction (MSC), while variable reduction was performed via Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Partial Least Squares (PLS). Classification was achieved using Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), PLS-DA, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) models. Regression models built using PLS, PCA, SVM, and MLP demonstrated high predictive performance, with the MLP model achieving an R² of 0.97 and a Root Mean Squared Error of Prediction (RMSEP) of 4.3%. The study highlights the effectiveness of NIR-HSI for rapid and nondestructive detection of adulteration in saffron.

**2**. **Hyperspectral Imaging and Chemometrics for Authentication of Extra Virgin Olive Oil: A Comparative Approach with FTIR, UV-VIS, Raman, and GC-MS**


<div style="text-align: justify;">
This work compares various analytical methods for detecting adulteration in extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) using hyperspectral imaging (HSI), FTIR, UV-Vis, Raman, and GC-MS spectroscopies. EVOO was adulterated with cheaper edible oils, including safflower oil, corn oil, soybean oil, canola oil, sunflower oil, and sesame oil, at varying concentrations (0–20%). The study applied Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) and PLS regression to classify and quantify adulteration. HSI combined with PLS-DA achieved 100% classification accuracy, while the overall PLS regression model using HSI data had the best prediction capabilities with an R² of 0.97 and RMSEP of 1.1%. The study suggests the potential of HSI as a fast and nondestructive method for detecting olive oil adulteration, outperforming traditional spectroscopic methods.

**3**. **Prediction of Essential Oil Content in Spearmint (Mentha Spicata) via NIR-Hyperspectral Imaging and Chemometrics**

<div style="text-align: justify;">
Spearmint (Mentha spicata) is cultivated for its essential oil (EO), widely used in food, beverage, and fragrance industries. This study investigates the potential of NIR-Hyperspectral Imaging (935–1720 nm) to predict EO content in dried spearmint (0.2–2.6%). Preprocessing techniques such as Multiplicative Scatter Correction (MSC) and Standard Normal Variate (SNV) were applied, with spectral variable selection using LASSO, PCA, and PLS. Regression models (PLS, SVM, and MLP) demonstrated good predictive performance, with the best model achieving an R² of 0.863 and an RMSE of 0.219% EO. These findings suggest NIR-HSI can be used for the rapid, nondestructive analysis of EO content in spearmint, with potential applications for other plant materials and food matrices.
